The probability of everyone in a group of n people having different birthdays, $$P(A)$$, can be represented as $$1-P(A^c)$$. $$P(A^c)$$ can be found by the combination of people with unique birthdays over the total combinations.
$$P(A^c) = \frac{1*(1-\frac{1}{365}) * (1-\frac{2}{365})*(1-\frac{3}{365})*...(1-\frac{n-1}{365})}{(365)^n}$$
This can be rewritten in r as 
exp(lchoose(365,n) + lfactorial(n) - n*log(365))

```{r setup}
library(MATH4753noah)
birthday(n = 20:25) 

```
